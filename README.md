# Flycycle Project

## Overview
In this project, we modify the Flycycle robot, donated by [ATR Corporation](http://www.atrcorp.com/) to the [Maryland Robotics Center](http://www.robotics.umd.edu/). This robot is a Virtual Reality (VR) exercise machine that provides a complete as well as an entertaining workout for the upper and the lower body. There is also an option to workout without the VR headset as well. The idea here is to combine the lower body workout of riding a cycle with the upper body workout of hand gliding. Using the feedback from the sensors, the user is completely immersed into the VR game which is controlled by his body movements. The full exercise entails activities like climbing, diving, banking and pedaling. 
## Demonstration
We have Chosen two games to show our progress so far. The first one is a flight simulator. we show the capability of the flycycle to pitch and roll using the Flycycle to fly in simulator. The same game is integrated as VR as well to gain a 360 degrees experience.

The second game is a racing game called Asphalt 8. This brings out the enthusiasm in children while physically working out.

# Future Work

The first steps now would be to test different games and carry out human trials. Later on we also plan to see if the Flycycle can be used for rehabilitation purposes for children with muscle dystrophy. 
Another objective is to develop a course and a competition with the Flycycle, wherein we teach students on developing virtual reality games which can then be integrated with the Flycycle.
